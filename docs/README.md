Welcome to **LadderJS**, a Node JS MVC framework inspired by Symfony, Yii or Ruby On Rails.

By using **LadderJS**, you'll benefit from the included:

* Router: using Express 4

* View layer: using Pug

* Authentication system: using Passport

* Data layer: using Sequelize

* Logger: using Winston

* Style layer: using LESS or SASS

* CRUD scaffolding

A demo app can be used as a boilerplate if you want to skip the first steps of the documentation.

Or use the LadderJS-CLI
